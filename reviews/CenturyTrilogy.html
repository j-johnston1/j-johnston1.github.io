							<p>The Century Trilogy is a huge undertaking, seamlessly blending the generations of five families over the course of nearly 100 years. Obviously Follett cannot go into the weeds of everything that happened over such a long period of time but he certainly hits all of the main events and manages to give them adequate detail and perspective for his audience's understanding. Follett is a such a crafty storyteller that, despite the constant moving around and the massive amount of pages found in each book, I remained invested throughout the entire series. I also felt like I got a condensed and entertaining history lesson. My two criticisms of the series are 1. its reliance on war as the primary source of conflict and difficulty for all of the characters and 2. its exclusion of any characters or points of view outside of the Western world. For me, the series lacked the powerful themes and symbolism found in Follett's "Pillars of the Earth" that would make me want to recommend these incredibly long books of historical fiction to everyone, so although I very much enjoyed the series, it is not a 5-star series.<br>

							<h2>Review</h2>
							<p>The Century Trilogy is one of Follet's meticulously researched tales of historical fiction, spanning decades and housed in three large tomes averaging ~1000 pages. We follow successive generations of five families of different nationalities (Welsh, English, German, Russian, and American) from 1911 to 1989, with an epilogue in 2008. Our characters are conveniently placed to be witness to most of the major political events of the West during the 20th century. You may notice that there are not any characters/families from outside of the West, which is one issue I would take with the book because it only focuses on history that is important to the West and ignores everything else that happened during the last century. However, I also understand that to have included more diversity would have made the books even longer and more complicated, so it was likely for practical reasons. The other issue I take is Follet's use of war and crises to drive the plot rather than using character work, even though the objective of the book is to establish how the world and its people have come together through the turmoil of the last century. I wish the story was a little more character-driven and less of a history lesson. But as a history lesson, it is incredibly entertaining and well-written, and I would definitely recommend the series to readers who aren't afraid of a long, historical journey.  Here is a more specific review of each book (<b>WARNING</b> - some spoilers):<br>
                                <br><i>Fall of Giants</i><br>
								In my opinion, the first book of the series is the strongest. I think for me this is because much more character work is done up front to get readers invested in the families with whom they are about to embark on a journey. The novel also covers a much shorter period of time, mostly condensed to the years of World War I, allowing us to watch our characters progress and develop over the course of a fairly typical timeframe in the writing world. But the biggest source of conflict for our characters is the war, not much else is occurring during this book. This is a fine choice, but also a common one, so the excellence of the writing is somewhat hampered by its unoriginality. Otherwise this is a very good book.
								<br><i>Winter of the World</i><br>
                                Book 2 picks up a little over a decade after the first book finishes with the next generation of children in our five families. Much like the first book, much of the conflict stems from war, this time WWII. However, one addition I really enjoyed in this book was a few characters that seemed to embody what our characters were fighting against - such as a Nazi Gestapo agent that repeatedly antagonizes our German protagonists. Having less nebulous antagonists helps to create more tension and a better story about the people instead of the war. This book may have been better than the first except but for a few characters from our families that I didn't care for in this generation, they weren't as well-developed or thought out so I didn't really care what happened to them. Overall still really good.
                                <br><i>Edge of Eternity</i><br>
                                The last book in the series is the weakest. Not only are we further separated from the original characters that made the first book so great, but this book also covers the most extensive period of time (approximately 30 years). Because so many years pass, there are constant leaps forward in time where our characters are suddenly at very different stages of their lives. I think these leaps can make it difficult to truly connect the new versions of our characters to the previous versions of themselves from just pages before, which makes it difficult to feel invested in them. So much is happening as well, it's easy to lose sight of how huge some of these events were because we are constantly jumping from place to place and time to time that we are quickly distanced from the event soon after it takes place. The amount of material covered in this book is absolutely impressive, but falls a little flat compared to the other two.
