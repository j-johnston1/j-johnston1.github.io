							<p>This is my second course from Professor Johnson and I've reached the conclusion that he is longwinded and enjoys taking the scenic route to the points he wishes to make. Unfortunately, the scenic route is not always the most interesting, especially when your destination is a controversial point of view that is not generally accepted in academic circles. Johnson's goal in this course was essentially to convince the audience of the correctness of his phenomenlogical approach to Christianity. There are some interesting lectures along the way, but also plenty of uninteresting lecures as well. Overall, I didn't think the course was worth wading through the 12 hours of material for the average student.</p>
							<h2>Review</h2>
							<p>Dr. Johnson spends his first several lectures arguing for certain definitions - of religion, of religious experience, etc. After a couple hours, the definitions are established and we do have a few interesting lectures looking at religious experience in the context of ancient Greco-Roman culture and of Jewish culture as a prelude to Christianity. At this point, we are 5+ hours into the course and we finally start looking at the early Christian experience. While I understand that setting the scene is important, I'm not sure that it warranted this much time spent on it. The lectures were interesting, but could have been condensed.<br>
                                Johnson then starts in on several of the religious experiences we can gather from the documentation of early Christians up through modern times: speaking in tongues, gathering for meals, healings, visions, etc. A lot of information here and at times the conversation turned to fun little tidbits that help with understanding modern American Evangelicalism. One of my main issues with this part of the course is Johnson's casual dismissal of common academic viewpoints with statements like "there is no evidence for it" when evidence is very much there (hence the viewpoint taken by academics...). Johnson at least admits that the stance he is looking to put forth in the lectures is controversial and not very popular, but I would hope for a fairer treatment of the material. Johnson concludes with a strong critique of academia's historical methodology in failing to understand religion as an experience, only focusing on the extraction of belief and meaning from limited historical documents. The arguments put forth definitely have merit, which is why the study of religion has transformed so much in the last two decades or so to try to capture this experience, but I don't think dismissing the groundwork laid by previous generations is the right call to make.<br>
                                If you're interested in a phenomenological approach to the study of early Christianity and understanding how it can be used more broadly, you might enjoy this course. It's really more of an advanced theoretical or methodological course. I don't think the average individual would find much of interest in it.
