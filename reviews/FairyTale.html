							<p>King is a fan of the slow build, relying on his writing style to keep you hooked and using the build to make the characters more real, more normal. This build may have been a bit too slow, about half the book passes before we even get to our world of fairy tales and then there is still a lot of world building and character introductions to go. King is basically starting a new story with only loose ties to the well-crafted and loveable first act. Even so, this was a fun coming-of-age novel with classic themes of good vs. evil that has the modern touch showing perhaps good and evil are not always as clear-cut as they seem. The biggest theme of the book, however, is the power of names and stories in shaping individuals and worlds - hence the title "Fairy Tale."<br>

							<h2>Review</h2>
							<p>This is a pretty average book for King, if I were to rank all of his books this would probably fall somewhere near the middle. It was fun and I loved that it was full of references to a variety of fairy tales (both classics like The Brothers Grimm and more modern like The Wizard of Oz or Neverending Story), classic horror writers (Lovecraft and Bradbury), and, of course, King's own extended universe. The story follows 17-year-old Charlie, who is secretly harboring some guilt about mistakes he has made and is seeking a way to repent and keep a promise he made with God to help others. An opportunity presents itself when Charlie saves the life of his grumpy, elderly neighbor and commits to aiding in the man's recovery. Charlie had no idea the size of the commitment he would be making in doing so because of the secret his neighbor kept - a secret that would lead Charlie to another world.<br>
                                The first part of the book that introduces Charlie and leads to him caring for his neighbor is a slow burn, but really takes the time to build our characters, make them real, make them likeable. Despite the lack of action and plot progression, this is probably the most enjoyable part of the story, a touching tale of relationships and loss and moving through grief to form new bonds. King gives these subjects all the attention and respect they deserve, which I can really appreciate except for the rest of the book moves in a completely new direction that makes the contrast between the two parts a little jarring. The second part is more focused on themes of good and evil, moral decision-making, and the power of stories/names in shaping individuals and the world - or, rather, worlds. Introducing a lot of new characters and settings, this part is fun but has a very different feel from the first part of the book that the reader has been invested in. So I liked the story, I think it's a fun read and would recommend it, but I didn't love it.
