							<p>Excellent examples and exercises to help students to apply the material, but the actual guidepoints seemed very intuitive, nothing new and surprising to take in. Or maybe I knew them all before from other coursework. But the course course is only 3 hours of lectures so great for anyone who feels the need to communicate better or who needs a refresher on the research out there.</p>
							<h2>Review</h2>
							<p>Friederichs opening lecture introduces the course and discusses a little about what we know about the brain's communication centers. A key component here is understanding how memory works because the goal of most communication is for the receiver to remember it. Friederichs emphasizes the importance of emotions in securing memories - highly emotional events often leave lasting impressions. Of course, we don't want to make someone cry every time we need them to remember something, but we do need them to have some sort of attachment to the information provided.<br>
                                Using this bit of neurology, we can design messages that stimulate the brain and holds its attention. Rhyming, alliteration, and mnemonic devices are all simple ways to make a message more memorable. One of the best ways to get the brain's attention is to make the information relevant to the person you are communicating with. People are more likely to pay attention to information that directly affects them in their daily living. That's why if someone says our name in a crowded and noisy room, we will likely shift our focus to that speaker and ignore the other conversations. If you can tell someone directly how what you have to say will affect their life, they will be more prepared to listen. <br>
                                Friederichs covers several other tricks of the trade in the rest of her course. She discusses the use of questions to stimulate curiosity or the use of analogies to relate new material to previous experiences that individuals can use to ingest your communications better. She reviews the importance of enriching the environment - eliminate distractions, don't just talk at people but get them involved, and use props or visuals to help reinforce what you have to say. In her final lecture, she discusses how to overcome roadblocks in communication. These include social anxiety and entrenched biases. The key is to connect.<br>
                                If you want to learn more about these topics, the lectures were clear and concise. Plus the additional exercises she recommended really help you to practice what she teaches, I believe that would be the most beneficial part of the course. But overall, there wasn't anything that particularly stood out to me and the course is only 3 hours so the material cannot be covered in-depth.
