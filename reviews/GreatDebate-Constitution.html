							<p>Although a brief 6 hours of lectures, Pangle manages to cover the Federalist/Anti-Federalist debate in a fair amount of detail. Although I have studied a decent amount of the history surrounding the constitutional convention and ratification, there were still new details and insights that Pangle was able to provide. But nothing in this series significantly changed my thinking or made me excited to know more.</p>
							<h2>Review</h2>
							<p>Pangle opens his lecture series by situating the students in the historical context of the constitutional convention, setting the stage for the debates that would take place over the next two years. Why was this meeting being held? Who were the key players? What were the issues? From there, Pangle builds on the historical understanding of republicanism and how Hamilton and Madison helped to reshape republicanism in the new constitution. Pangle then delivers his lectures in a sort of back-and-forth manner, with one lecture dedicated to the objections raised by the Anti-Federalists and the following lecture dedicated to how the Federalists (chiefly Hamilton and Madison in "The Feeralist Papers") countered the objections raised. In this way, Pangle provides a much more fleshed out view of Anti-Federalist thought than many other authors or lecturers might provide, giving them a stage in order to better understand why the ratification was so contested. Pangle concludes with a brief summary of the Federalists' victory but not without some compromise, showing that some key components of the constitution were added because of the Anti-Federalist backlash. His lectures brought new details and insights to my understanding of what took place. However, this is not the most exciting topic and, despite best efforts, the lectures don't really help to make it more exciting and accessible. I would only recommend to people who already have a serious interest in learning more about the original debate surrounding the American Constitution.</p>
