							<p>The lectures are exactly what they profess to be - a brief accounting of our historical knowledge of Jesus and then a rather thorough review of the gospel literature. And by gospel literature I mean more than those gospels found in the New Testament. Johnson takes us on a journey through the various understandings of the good news in early Christianity, exploring the infancy gospels, gnostic gospels, and other non-canonical gospels. His 18 hours of lectures are well-structured and easy to follow and his approach to the gospels from a literary perspective (as opposed to a factual, historical one) brought new light and understanding to the text. I would say, however, I was not as roped in by manay of his lectures on the non-canonical gospels as I was for thonse on the canonical ones.</p>
							<h2>Review</h2>
							<p>Dr. Johnson spends his first several lectures reviewing the limited factual knowledge we have about Jesus and how perspectives about those facts and the early Christian writings have changed or developed over time. He speaks on the quest for the historical Jesus and how the idea of what that looks like has changed over the past couple centuries. This can be interesting stuff, I had heard most of it before, but Johnson drags on a bit in these lectures and openly admits its purposeful. In the last lecture on the historical Jesus, Johnson says he is intentionally dragging out the story to make his listeners wait much like the early Christians had to wait decades until the gospels were finally written down and circulated. While this is a fun little object lesson for him, it did detract a bit from the quality and value of these first several lectures. <br>
                                After the historical overview, however, Johnson dives into his literary analysis of the canonical gospels and I think this is the part of the series where Dr. Johnson's knowledge and teaching ability really shine through. Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John each receive 4 excellent lectures reviewing the stylistic choices of each author, the literary themes, what ties them to the other gospels and what makes them stand apart. Johnson paints Mark as a gospel where Jesus is shrouded in mystery and true believers must receive their own witness of His sacrifice. Matthew is a Jewish gospel where Jesus is the embodiment of Jewish laws and traditions. Luke portrays Jesus in the tradition of the prophets, who preach against the authorities and minister to those on the fringes of society. John is a gospel focused much more on the nature and divinity of Jesus. I would recommend this series for these 16 lectures alone. <br>
                                Johnson spends the final third of the series talking about the non-canonical gospels. He takes time to touch on the basic historical background and some prominent examples for each category of non-canonical gospel texts, which include infancy gospels, Jewish Christian narrative gospels, and gnostic gospels. Some of these lectures were interesting, but I found others were not so much. They are often a mix of history and some literary analysis, but something about the pure literary lens of the lectures on the canonical gospels is what made them so good. The back and forth in these lectures between historical context and literary review make them a little more difficult to follow and enjoy in my opinion.
