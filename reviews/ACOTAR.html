							<p>Maas' hugely popular series is full of drama, action, and romance, everything a good story needs. But very little of the story feels original. The first two books very obviously borrow from other sources, simply wrapping the other stories in a newly imagined setting. All the standard fantasy tropes are followed, which meant very few surprises. The story is well-told and popular for a reason, but I didn't love it. The only thing that it really contributed to the greater adventure-fantasy genre is more frequent and detailed "magical" sex scenes.<br>

							<h2>Review</h2>
							<p>The "ACOTAR" series is so popular that I supposed I had to read it eventually to see what the hype is about. But it's a hype I don't really understand. The books followed popular storylines and kept to all of the fantasy tropes, there was nothing really new or exciting in my opinion. I think that's a common problem for me and fantasy - the stories have been done so many times that unless the author finds a way to mix things up I won't find it too exciting. And no, adding sex scenes with faeries and their animal features/noises (a lot of growling and roaring in this book...) is not changing the story enough for me. Here is a more specific review of each book (<b>WARNING</b> - some spoilers):<br>
                                <br><i>A Court of Thorns and Roses</i><br>
                                Approximately 75% of this book was basically a retelling of Beauty and the Beast. Feyre goes to live with a beastly faerie in exchange for having her family spared. She is planning her escape but a timid attraction begins to form after the beast saves her from other beasts (although in this encounter Feyre shows she is much more capable than Belle - and somehow more capable than a majority of the faeries in the land with superhuman abilities...). That's when the beast begins to show her a library/gallery and she loves art and realizes he's probably not so bad. Even the dress that Feyre wears when she finally starts to feel like displaying herself to the faerie prince is described just like the one that Belle wears in the Disney movie - golden, tighter around the waist, puffed sleeves, etc. Very obvious reference. Instead of making the servants invisible because they have been turned into furniture and therefore are not obviously there, Maas makes them invisible simply by a magic that hides them. The one different scene in this portion of the book is that the faeries have an orgy to celebrate the solstice, which is where Feyre is introduced to a Gaston-like character named Rhysand: extremely attractive, all the females want him, the strongest faeirie, but he gives off shady, lusty vibes and has done some terrible things that people are aware of. And he has a special liking for her after this encounter.<br>
                                Although this scene is the only difference in story structure, the themes from Beauty and the Beast (you know, the part that actually provides a moral to the story) are flaunted at every turn. Although our beast can be beastly, he is not actually trapped in a beast form. His curse is to have a masque over his eyes like he is always at a masquerade, but Feyre has no trouble seeing that his body is one of the most attractive she has ever seen. He is also never cruel, providing for her every whim and looking after her family. Gone is the idea of overcoming outward appearances and a calloused personality in order to find the true and tender center of the beast and mutual adoration. Instead, everything in Feyre's life is made easier by this kidnapping.<br>
                                The story finally digresses at the storming of the beast's castle, where he and the castle are taken captive and Feyre decides to rescue them. There are trials, character exposition, etc. and this last 20% or so of the book is where I finally started to enjoy it because the story changed, things were different. But not good enough to make me really like it after the first 75%, a 3-star read.<br>
                                <br><i>A Court of Mist and Fury</i><br>
                                Book 2 starts off much stronger, with Feyre suffering from PTSD after her trials under the mountain and slipping into a depression. Luckily(?) she is kidnapped from her externally perfect but internally depressive state by none other than our Gaston character, who takes on a more Hades-like role in this sort of retelling of Hades and Persephone. I am not as familiar with the Greek myth as I am with Beauty and the Beast (I have toddler into princesses so I hear their stories more often), but I understand enough to know a great part of the beginning of this book loosely follows the myth. And the rest of the book is spent trying to undo all the character profiles established in the first book, just really tearing down a lot of the preconceptions in the readers' minds. Despite really destroying much of the previous book, I think this book is my favorite in the series. It does lag a bit in places at the beginning, her training is really slow to progress to anything useful and follows the trope of needing to be unnecessarily frustrated for anything to work (though in this case it's more of a sexual frustration than true anger). But the characters and their actions start to finally make a little more sense, we are treated to some decent action, and it ends on a real cliff-hanger. Liked it much more, still didn't love it, a 4-star read.<br>
                                <br><i>A Court of Mist and Fury</i><br>
                                Book 3 continues the momentum from the end of Book 2 but quickly upsets me by magically undoing the repercussions that many characters suffered at the end of Book 2, creating a sense that there is little risk through much of the rest of the book because our main characters can magically come back from the brink without lasting consequences. And all the suffering that took place throughout the rest of the book was mostly ephemeral in the end, stakes might appear high at some points but they were quickly lowered, at least for our main characters. I will say that this book is much more fast-paced and action-packed than the previous ones, which kept things interesting and exciting. But I also felt like there were too many pieces of the story all being introduced at the same time around the 25% mark, it was difficult to be interested in any one of them in particular since they all had a pretty large presence on stage until the climactic final battle. I think overall I preferred the slow character development of the second book to the constant jumping around that Feyre did in this book, but there were more scenes in this book that I enjoyed because they were intense and exciting, also a 4-star read.
