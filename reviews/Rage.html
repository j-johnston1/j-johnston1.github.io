							<h1>"Rage" by Stephen King</h1>
                            <p>Premise: A disturbed boy snaps and takes a class of his fellow students hostage at gun point, forcing them to confess their secret bad behavior and confront the reasons for their choices.</p>

							<p>I did not expect to like a book such as this as much as I did. I didn't think it was great, but more interesting than I expected. Not one I would go around recommending to people, but I also don't think it's terrible if you are genuinely interested and can get past the violence.<br>
                                Advisory: Violence, Language, Sexual Content

							<h2>Review</h2>
							<p>Stephen King asked that his publisher discontinue this book after school shootings became a thing and I can completely understand his decision to do so. The book almost glorifies the experience, which I don't approve of. That being said, it was not what I expected. It's almost like "The Breakfast Club" but with a more violent start. The young gunman kills a teacher and takes a classroom full of his peers hostage. While locked inside, he forces them to confront their differences - why does the fat girl lash out so much? What secrets is the popular, pretty girl ashamed of admitting? Who secretly holds a rebellious streak? Is the jock really so brave? Can the kid with poor hygiene truly be responsible for the circumstances he was born into? The students begin to look beyond their differences and learn to empathize with each other. Definitely not the direction or outcome I would have expected, but actually a kind of nice one. Still doesn't excuse the actions of our main character, but does make the read somewhat worthwhile.
                            </p>
