							<h1>"Sleeping Beauties" by Stephen King and Owen King</h1>
                            <p>Premise: A virus that only affects women sweeps the world in a pandemic, leaving most of the female sex in a coma-like state. How quickly will the world go to hell without women there to help keep men on the right track? What must be done to bring the women back?</p>

							<p>This book was difficult for me to rate. I really enjoyed it but I also had several issues with the strange plot. The characters were as compelling as usual for King, and most of the members of the antagonistic force had understandable motives, which I appreciate in a good book. Overall, the thought experiment of the book, to me, outshone the issues with the plot enough for me to rate this a 4.<br>

							<h2>Review</h2>
							<p>Stephen King teams up with his son to write an openly feminist story. This isn't surprising given King's previous bibliography, but ironic to me that the men team up to write a story on feminism instead of bringing a woman in on it. Irony aside, Sleeping Beauties is a mostly enjoyable thought experiment about how quickly men might run the world into the ground without the influence of women. What I enjoyed most about the book is that the reason the men grow violent so quickly is because of their fear of losing their wives/daughters/mothers. This is not a story of a few disturbed, violent, and power-hungry men seizing an opportunity when the world is in chaos. It's a story about how seemingly ordinary men will go to great lengths to protect those they love, but without a voice of reason to keep them in check they can cross boundaries that they really shouldn't cross. The thing is, for many men (not all, but many) this voice of reason is a woman in their life - a spouse or mother or sister that counsels them. So without that voice to make them stop and think, even a reasonable man might move beyond reason to seize something that can make the fear go away. There are some cruel, misogynistic men involved in this story, yes, but for the most part you can empathize with the antagonists who are looking for any way to get their family back. One thing I love in a story is the ability to understand why all the characters do what they do and that's mostly accomplished here. <br>
                                The one character I really couldn't wrap my head around was Eve. Although some exposition is done toward the end of the book, the whole purpose and mechanism of Eve and the disease is left unsatisfyingly vague. Maybe I should be used to this as many of King's large-scale works have an unsatisfying ending, but having an exciting story build over hundreds of pages only to leave you somewhat satisfied at the end is always disappointing. To be clear, it's not the ambiguity of the ending I am disappointed in, only the lack of exposition surrounding Eve and the virus. This is the main reason I had such difficulty rating this story. The rest of the character work was great and the plot was fast-paced and exciting despite the length of the story, but the final exposition was weak and unsatisfying. Ultimately, for me, the character work and the fun execution of this thought experiment were strong enough to rate this a 4 despite my issues with the plot.
