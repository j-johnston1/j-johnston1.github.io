							<p>A collection of 4 novellas by King, in my opinion one of his better novella collections, several enjoyable stories.<br>
								Advisory: Some Violence, Some Language
							</p>
							<h2>Review</h2>
							<p>The If It Bleeds collection seems focused on stories where our protagonist's inner worlds become difficult to distinguish from the outer world - mostly because what is happening seems completely unreal. Here is a more specific review of each book (<b>WARNING</b> - minor spoilers):</br>
                                <br><i>Mr. Harrigan's Phone</i><br>
                                This story starts out as a fairly common King story: that of an unlikely friendship between a young boy (Craig) and a cranky old man (Mr. Harrigan), each having something to teach the other. When Mr. Harrigan dies, Craig leaves voicemails on the dead man's phone as a way of coping with the troubles he's having. When Craig's troubles coincidentally disappear, he begins to suspect that, somehow, Mr. Harrigan is receiving his messages and responding in gruesome fashion. Is it all just a coincidence? Or is a supernatural force at work? I found it an enjoyable read.
								<br><i>The Life of Chuck</i><br>
                                A strange story told in three parts, the story moving backward through time. I had to reread parts of this story to really understand it, but once I did grasp it all I really liked it. The story plays with the idea that each individual inhabits their own world with unique perspectives and outlooks that can change depending on circumstance. The loss of a life is more than the loss of an individual, it's the loss of their unique world. I don't want to spoil too much of the story, but I found it a worthwhile read.
                                <br><i>If It Bleeds</i><br>
                                If It Bleeds is a sequel to the book "The Outsider." This is another adventure with Holly Gibney, I will review it more in my review of the Holly Gibney series.
                                <br><i>Rat</i><br>
                                To me, this was the weakest story in the collection. A story about a short-story writer who thinks he finally has a shot at completing a successful novel, ends up unfortunately stuck during a snow storm and with a high fever. During what he believes to be a fever dream, he makes a strange deal with a talking rat. When reality returns, he begins to question if it was truly a dream. The story fits with the rest of the collection, but I didn't find it as enjoyable.
