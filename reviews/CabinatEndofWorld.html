							<h1>"The Cabin at the End of the World" by Paul Tremblay</h1>
                            <p>Premise: A family on vacation at a cabin in the woods is approached by a group of strangers who offer them a choice: save their family or save humanity.</p>

							<p>The premise of this story is very interesting and I have to admit that Tremblay had me wanting to know what came next every step of the way, but I was always disappointed. The way some characters exited, the reveals, and especially the ending - all left me disappointed and wanting something else.<br>

							<h2>Review</h2>
							<p>One of the first characters introduced in the book is a large man named Lenny who has an easier time communicating with children than with adults. Despite picking up on this very obvious reference to Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men", I was still unprepared for the event it foreshadowed. And after this particular scene in the book, I was pretty much done, I did not enjoy it. I have to hand it to Tremblay for coming up with such a bizarre story that I could not put it down, but I constantly found myself disappointed with the way the plot played out. Even with all the twists and turns, very little plot progression actually took place. Then the ending left me depressed. No matter which side of the ambiguous ending you choose to believe, it's depressing. Not a book I would generally recommend. <br>
                                I have to say that Shyamalan's adaptation of the book was better for me. The Lenny scene is removed (which does really make the character allusion mostly arbitrary but that was okay with me) and the ambiguity of the ending is removed. Shyamalan gives me the ending that I would have preferred, which I cannot say is less sad but at least offers hope for a brighter future. I would say pick the movie instead of the book, but the movie is not amazing either, just better in my opinion.
