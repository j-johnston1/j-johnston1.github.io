							<p>Like other books I have read by John Green, the plot for Turtles All the Way Down is not very interesting. There are plenty of plotholes, undeveloped ideas, and bland relationships. So why did I give this 4 stars? The portrayal of Aza's struggles with mental illness are just that good. The best dive into a mind of anxiety and compulsions I have seen. I shouldn't be surprised since I know Green also struggles with these so he knows what they are like, but to translate that to words on a page I think is difficult and he did such a great job.<br>

							<h2>Review</h2>
							<p>John Green's Aza character brings this book home. Did I particularly like her? No, not really. But being inside her head as Green described in-depth the compulsions and anxiety of a young person struggling with mental health was fascinating, relatable, and an excellent empathy-building exercise. Green's incredible ability to put into words the feelings so few people can begin to describe really makes this book a decent read. There are also some thought-provoking philosophical ideas and perspectives for coping with the anxiety that were interesting as well. However, the rest of the story was literarily weak. Most of the characters were uninteresting and a little annoying. Aza's relationships were not well-developed and left incomplete. And the main plotline for the investigation into the missing billionaire's disappearance was unsatisfying. I would not go into this book with high expectations for an exciting story, but, despite its faults, I think it's a great read for better understanding mental health. 
                            </p>
