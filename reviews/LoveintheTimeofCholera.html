							<p>This book is a beautiful story about what love looks like during all the periods of the human lifespan and recognizing the extraordinary in the quotidian. The story lacked Márquez's signature magical realism, but I preferred it that way because it placed more emphasis on the beauty of the ordinary. The story starts and ends pretty strong, but it is long and lags in places in the middle so I take away 1 star for that.<br>
                                Advisory: sexual content

							<h2>Review</h2>
							<p> Although entitled "Love in the Time of Cholera", this is really a story about love in all times. One of the central themes of the story is that love looks different not just from person to person but also from time to time. The story mainly follows the viewpoints of three characters - Florentino Ariza, Fermina Daza, and Dr. Juvenal Urbino. As we jump between vantage points, we notice that certain events that seem chock-full of meaning to one individual may seem banal to another. What one interprets as an act of love, another may interpret as a desire to harm. As our characters age and change, so do their interpretations of the events they live/lived through, shifting the meaning and significance of what took place. This happens frequently in our lives, but often so slowly that we fail to pick up on it until it's too late. This book encourages the reader to reflect on those changes now and think about how we will wish we had acted looking back on the present.<br>
                                My main issue with the story was Florentino - I did not care for the character and I sometimes felt my interest dwindling during long stretches of his viewpoint. He has some redeeming qualities, but his obsessive love makes a lot of his story feel a bit repetitive, his character progression is very slow. I believe Márquez made him a little unlikeable intentionally - although a majority of the story takes place from his viewpoint, I felt like the main character was Fermina and we were meant to side with her impressions and decisions concerning Florentino. He was a much more likeable character during the points in the plot where she also viewed him favorably. However, most of the time he was a little creepy with his obsession, stalker-ish, and the fact that his relentless pursuit was portrayed to be romantic in any way is disoncerting.<br>
                                Anyway, bit of a mixed bag, but I do believe the beauty of the story and the themes do outweigh any of the negatives. Worth the read.
